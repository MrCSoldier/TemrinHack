# QnA
### Is TerminHack safe to run?
Yes. The developer(s) intend to create a safe and enjoyable experience while ensuring that nothing bad or unintentional happens, and i can assure you that. This game __WILL NOT TOUCH YOUR CRUCIAL SYSTEM FILES, SETTINGS OR USER DEFINED DATA OR CHANGE ANY SETTINGS MADE BY THE USER OR THE SYSTEM.__ This game __will not__ go outside of your machine, and at most, will only check to see if wifi is enabled in order for the game to replicate offline mode. 

The game will only do video, audio as well as input related events such as fake disconnection of keyboard (features as such will be thoroughly tested by as many play-testers as possible to ensure that everything will go back to normal. Dont worry. If anything, you can follow some of the  report it back to me).

### Does it actually execute commands, malware and scripts? 
No, it will not. The game __will fake this__ using visual and auditory elements.

For example. this game replicates file systems within a JSON file using JSON as the language. This means each file and folder in that file is an object with 3 properties. You'll see what i mean when you read the code.
